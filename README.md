# EmployeeOnboardingRPA_
This product allows a less hassle-free onboarding process for HR and creates an effective and smooth communication between HR and other departments. It’s main purpose is to decrease the stress on the HR of informing other departments about a new entry by simply just a button click.This feature is one of our USPs. Alerts are also segregated at one place,so as the user doesn’t have to keep rechecking the mails for updates. This is needed so as the HR can focus on other aspects such as handling new employees issues or to arrange meetings rather than being stuck in updates/alerts and sending mails to departments.
